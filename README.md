# EightQueens
In the eight queens puzzle, eight queens must be placed on a standard 8×8 chess board so 
that no  *queen can attack another. The center figure below shows an invalid solution; 
two queens can attack *each other diagonally. The figure on the right shows a valid solution. 
Given a description of a  *chess board, your job is to determine whether or not it represents 
a valid solution to the eight  *queens puzzle.
